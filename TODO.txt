We need to weight on article count and sentiment not total chunks as this would favour long articles - done
Currently it is returning chunks as articles, which is wrong - done
Could the chunking miss relevance about the article as a whole?
I.e. there is a positive chunk that refers to the earlier stock but does not mention it explicitly?
Bring web_sentiment in line with rss_sentiment - done
